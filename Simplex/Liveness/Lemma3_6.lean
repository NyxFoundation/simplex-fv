/-- **Lemma 3.6 (The Effect of Faulty Leaders).** If every honest process has entered
    iteration `h` by some time `t > GST`, then every honest process will have entered
    iteration `h+1` by time `t + 3∆ + δ`.

    Proof (the paper's two cases, with the delivery/notarization content of Case 1
    folded into the case hypothesis `hcase`, mirroring how Lemma 3.5's subclaims are
    threaded):
    - **Case 1** — every honest timer in iteration `h` fires: each honest process
      casts `⟨vote, h, ⊥_h⟩` by `≤ t+3∆`, which is in every honest view by
      `max(GST, t+3∆+δ) = t+3∆+δ`; these votes notarize `⊥_h`, so every honest
      process has seen a notarized height-`h` chain by `t+3∆+δ`
      (`tv.SawNotar q h (t+3∆+δ)`) and enters `h+1` by then (`saw_entered`).
    - **Case 2** — some honest `p`'s iteration-`h` timer does not fire: then `p`
      entered `h+1` before its timer could fire, i.e. by `t+3∆`; Lemma 3.4
      (`lemma_3_4`) propagates this to every honest process by `max(GST, t+3∆+δ)`,
      which collapses to `t+3∆+δ` because `t > GST` and `δ, ∆ ≥ 0`.
    Deterministic; no axiom, no `sorry`. -/

/-- **Iterating Lemma 3.6 over `k` faulty-leader iterations.** If every honest process
    is in iteration `h` by time `t > GST`, and at each of the next `k` iterations the
    Lemma 3.6 case split holds (`advance`), then every honest process has entered
    iteration `h+k` by time `t + k·(3∆+δ)`. Pure induction on `k`, each step invoking
    `lemma_3_6`; this is the deterministic backbone of Theorem 3.3's
    `4δ + k·(3∆+δ)` worst-case bound. -/
